Testimonial Points:
--------------------

When Moses signs a contract with {Vashti, Esther} then Moses gets one
testimonial for Vashti and for Esther, while Vashti and Esther get
one testimonial for Moses each. They can each spend it on writing
a testimonial for them.

This is maintained in the testimonial points table. If Moses hires
Joshua again without having written a testimonial for him again, then
he can still only write one testimonial for him for both cases.

This a functional spec for a freelancer-finding board. It is similar to 
getafreelancer.com / rentacoder.com except for the following key differences:

1. The prospective freelancers will be able to reveal their true 
identities, and link to their web sites, portfolios, email addresses, etc.
This way there will be something better to offer besides just wage.

2. People will be able to comment on the offers of the freelancers - for
example, to ask questions or make remarks. One can also comment on other
people's comment (Slashdot-like nested comments).

The revenue from the site will be based on people paying to post task offers.

------------------------

Case studies:

1. Posting an offer:
--------------------

Moses is the leader of Bney-Yisra'el and he's looking for someone to build
a site to announce the Exodus from Egypt. He goes to www.yonathan.tld. There 
he registers, waits for the confirmation email and gets it.

He then goes to the "Post a new Offer" task, fills in the text (in HTML), and
previews it, and fills in his credit card details. He submits the job.

Moses will receive the offers that the freelancers post to his job entry
via email. In the email and offers he'll find a link to their 
http://www.yonathan.tld/~vashti/ page (see below), with testimonials,
and other information such as homesite, and email. He can use that to
decide what to do.

Once he finds a freelancer or gets tired of the useless offers that he sees,
he can close and archive the thread, while leaving a message why that was that
case.

If that doesn't happen, the offer will close automatically after 2 months.

2. Finding jobs:
----------------

Vashti has just been fired from her permanent job as queen of the Persian
Empire. She decides to try her luck working on jobs. She goes to 
www.yonathan.tld, opens an account, and feels in her details:

1. Personal web site. (optional but recommended)

2. Email. (required - could be hidden)

3. IM accounts.

4. Portfolio.

5. Resume - link or text.

6. Bio - short text (up to 4000 Unicode chars)

7. Phone number (international, etc.)

8. Others - FILL IN.

Then she waits for the confirmation email. Once it arrives and she finishes
registering, she goes on looking for jobs.

Jobs in yonathan.tld are organised according to tags - like perl, python, php,
web, etc. 

Vashti subscribes to a tag query (composed of several OR's of several AND'ed
tags) and can view the RSS query. Or optionally receive an RSS feed for it.

She can also serialise the query to XML for later perusal and for sharing
among her fired queens friends.

Once she finds a job she likes, she posts a comment saying:

<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Hi!

My name is Vashti. I have 25 years of experience doing PHP+MySQL, and
I'm very professional. If you want, look at 
<a href="http://www.vashti-portfolio.tld/">my portfolio</a>.

I'll get the jobs done in two weeks, and charge 1000 USD.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>

After posting a few jobs like that, she gets a gig.

3. Writing a Testimonial
------------------------

Moses is incredibly happy with Vashti's execution of the Exodus site.
As such he decides to write a testimonial in her favour. He fires up his
web browser surfs to Vashti's page, writes a testimonial and submits it.

Vashti sees that, but has a comment, so she posts a comment on Moses'
testimonials fixing an inaccuracy. 

Moses recieves a notification by email about Vashti's comment and writes a
reply (via the Email's comment link) to her comment, acknowledging that there
was a problem with his testimonial.

That way, both Moses and Vashti are happy.

3.b: there will be a meta-user for testimonials on the entire site.

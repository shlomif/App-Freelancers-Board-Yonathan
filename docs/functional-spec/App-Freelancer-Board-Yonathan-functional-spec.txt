This a functional spec for a freelancer-finding board. It is similar to 
getafreelancer.com / rentacoder.com except for the following key differences:

1. The prospective freelancers will be able to reveal their true 
identities, and link to their web sites, portfolios, email addresses, etc.
This way there will be something better to offer besides just wage.

2. People will be able to comment on the offers of the freelancers - for
example, to ask questions or make remarks. One can also comment on other
people's comment (Slashdot-like nested comments).

The revenue from the site will be based on people paying to post task offers.

------------------------

Case studies:

1. Posting an offer:
--------------------

Moses is the leader of Bney-Yisra'el and he's looking for someone to build
a site to announce the Exodus from Egypt. He goes to www.yonathan.tld. There 
he registers, waits for the confirmation email and gets it.

He then goes to the "Post a new Offer" task, fills in the text (in HTML), and
previews it, and fills in his credit card details. He submits the job.

Moses will receive the offers that the freelancers post to his job via email.
Once he finds a freelancer or gets tired of the useless offers that he sees,
he can close and archive the thread, while leaving a message why that was that
case.

If that doesn't happen, the offer will close automatically after 2 months.
